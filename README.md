Tentative outline for algorithm curriculum (currently based on lectures from last course offering)

Course: [Stanford's Algorithm: Design and Analysis, Part 1 by Tim Roughgarden](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)

Book: [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://www.algorist.com/)

* The tilde ~ means something is optional, but for the purposes of this group you should probably read/complete it.
* Exercises from the book would probably be good practice but can be considered optional; course exercises take precedence.
